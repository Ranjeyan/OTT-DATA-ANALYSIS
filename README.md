# OTT-DATA-ANALYSIS

The OTT Data Analysis project aims to provide
insights into the performance of three popular
streaming platforms - Netflix, Hotstar, and
Amazon Prime - using Power BI. With Power BI, the
project can deliver many insights in a visually
appealing and interactive format, making it easier
for stakeholders to understand and act on the
findings.
